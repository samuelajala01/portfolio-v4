            Hey there! I&#39;m currently studying Electronics and Computer Engineering at Lagos State University, but honestly, I&#39;ve always been more than just a student. Ever since I saw Honda&#39;s ASIMO robot at 12, I&#39;ve been hooked on the idea that machines/robots can do more than just existâ€”they can learn, adapt, and change lives.

That moment sparked my love for Machine Learning and Embedded Systems, and I&#39;ve been chasing that passion ever since. Whether I&#39;m designing hardware, writing code, or bringing the two together to solve real problems, I&#39;m always up for a challenge. I love the process of figuring things outâ€”how systems work, how they can get better, and how we can use them to make life easier

          <p className="text-[1.1rem] md:text-[1.4rem] opacity-75">When I&#39;m not busy with tech, you&#39;ll probably find me playing a game of chess, smashing out a round of table tennis, or getting lost in a great book. I&#39;m all about learning, tinkering, and exploring new ideas.

Looking ahead, I&#39;m excited to take what I know and use it to build impactful solutions in Robotics and AIâ€”systems that automate tasks, improve efficiency, and help us all do more with less effort. If you&#39;re someone who&#39;s just as passionate about using tech to solve real-world problems, I&#39;d love to connect. Let&#39;s see how we can build something amazing together. ðŸš€</p></div>
